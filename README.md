# Fable Advisor

**Opus runs the show. Cheaper typing, smarter escalation, and a Fable review before anything ships.**

Claude Code lets every subagent run on a different model — and lets the session itself run on a different model than its subagents. This plugin exploits that with the **architect pattern**: your session runs on **Opus**, acting as a full-time architect. It owns requirements, decomposition, specs, and verification — routes every implementation task to the right lane — and gets a **Fable 5** review of the finished work before calling anything done:

| Lane | Producer | Invocation | Route here when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Routine | **GPT-5.6 Sol** (high reasoning) | `codex-implementer` agent (default) | The spec fully determines the outcome — Codex does the typing via the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) |
| High-complexity | **Fable 5** | `fable-implementer` agent | One-off tasks where judgment the spec can't capture decides the outcome: subtle concurrency, hard debugging, security-sensitive paths, wide refactors |
| Review | **Fable 5** | `fable-advisor` agent | Commitment boundaries, and **always once at the end** — the advisor reviews the accumulated changes in two passes, clean read first, before the architect reports done |

Tokens route by capability: Opus emits judgment and specs, the cheap cross-vendor lane emits the bulk of the code, and Fable — the most expensive model available — is spent only where it changes outcomes: the hardest implementations and the final review. Because the routine lane is a *different model family* than the architect, cross-vendor review is built into the routing, not bolted on. For high-stakes work, run `codex-implementer` and `fable-implementer` on the same spec and let the architect pick the stronger diff.

The plugin ships the **orchestration skill** — the routing doctrine that teaches the session when to use each lane, the cost discipline that keeps expensive-model token volume minimal (emit judgment not volume, keep context lean, reason once then hand off), the five-part spec contract that makes context-free delegation safe, the context inheritance grades that decide what a receiving agent may and may not be told, and the verification rules that keep every lane honest.

## Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add DannyMac180/fable-advisor
claude plugin install fable-advisor@fable-advisor
```

Updating an existing installation to the latest release:

```
claude plugin marketplace update fable-advisor
claude plugin update fable-advisor@fable-advisor
```

Then start your session as the architect:

```
/model opus
```

**Lite mode — one file, 30 seconds.** Don't want the full pattern? Copy [`agents/fable-advisor.md`](agents/fable-advisor.md) into `~/.claude/agents/` and keep your session on Sonnet. You get advisor consults at commitment boundaries without the orchestration layer (see "Advisor-only mode" below).

## Requirements

- **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.170** with a subscription that includes Fable 5 (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise — all current consumer plans qualify).
- **No Fable access** (e.g. API-key billing)? Change `model: fable` → `model: opus` in the advisor and implementer files. Same pattern, the Fable roles shift down to Opus.
- **Codex lane (the default implementer):** the `codex-implementer` agent needs the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated (`npm i -g @openai/codex`, then `codex login`). It invokes **GPT-5.6 Sol** as `gpt-5.6-sol` with `model_reasoning_effort=high`. GPT-5.6 access may be limited during preview; without model access, an installed/authenticated CLI, or successful authentication, the agent reports `STATUS: unavailable` — it never silently falls back to a Claude model — and the Fable lanes remain unaffected.
- Heads-up: if a pinned Claude model isn't available on your account, Claude Code silently falls back to your session model — the pattern degrades quietly rather than erroring. If results feel unremarkable, check your plan. (This quiet fallback applies only to Claude model pins — the codex lane always fails loudly with a structured error.)

Model resolution order in Claude Code: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env var → per-invocation `model` parameter → agent frontmatter → session model.

## Use it

With the session on Opus, just ask for work — the orchestration skill routes it:

```
Add rate limiting to our public API. Design it, delegate the
implementation, and verify the evidence before you call it done.
```

The architect writes the spec, picks the lane (rate limiting touches concurrency — a good case for `fable-implementer`, or for racing it against `codex-implementer` and picking the stronger diff), reads the diff and verification evidence when the report comes back, sends the finished work to `fable-advisor` for the final review, and only then reports done.

To make the doctrine always-on, add one line to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```
You are the architect — minimize your own token volume. Delegate all
implementation through the orchestration skill's routing table (never
type code yourself), delegate broad codebase exploration to cheap
read-only agents, verify evidence before accepting any lane's report,
and get a fable-advisor review before reporting any deliverable done.
```

## Commitment boundaries and the final review

Even the architect gets a second opinion. The `fable-advisor` agent is a read-only skeptic — consulted before architecture decisions, migrations, API designs, whenever a problem has resisted two attempts, and **always once at the end of a deliverable**, where it reads the accumulated diff against the stated goal rather than the conversation, and returns ship / fix-first / rethink. It never implements.

The final review runs in **two passes**, because a reviewer that inherits the implementer's framing inherits its blind spots. Pass 1 is `facts` grade: the diff, the goal, the constraints, and a *silence gap* — files structurally inside the blast radius that nobody's report mentions — and it returns numbered findings. Pass 2 hands over the implementer's claims as a list of assertions to falsify, and a finding may only be withdrawn against named file:line evidence. Independence comes from the ordering, not from starving the reviewer: the clean read is on the record before the claims arrive. The doctrine ships with dated retreat conditions so the second pass can be retired on ledger evidence if anchoring never shows up.

## Advisor-only mode (the original pattern)

The minimal arrangement, for when you'd rather skip the orchestration layer: run the session on Sonnet and consult `fable-advisor` only at commitment boundaries.

```
Migrate our checkout sessions from Postgres to Redis — plan it,
consult your advisor before committing, then implement.
```

A typical consult costs cents. To make it automatic, add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```
Before committing to any architecture decision, migration, or refactor
touching 3+ files, consult the fable-advisor agent and act on its verdict.
```

## FAQ

**Is this Anthropic's "advisor tool"?** No — that's a server-side API feature. These are plain Claude Code subagents plus a skill: readable, editable, no beta flags.

**Does this work on claude.ai?** No — subagent model routing is Claude Code only (CLI, desktop, VS Code, web).

**Why not just run everything on Fable?** You can. It's excellent. It's also the most expensive lane per token, and most of a session's tokens are orchestration and implementation mechanics that Opus and the codex lane handle at near-parity. Spend the premium where it changes outcomes: the hardest tasks and the final review.

**Upgrading from v3?** v4 restructures the routing: the session architect moves from Fable to **Opus**, the Grok 4.5 lane is **removed**, `codex-implementer` (GPT-5.6 Sol) becomes the default typing lane, and Fable's premium is refocused on the new `fable-implementer` high-complexity lane plus a now-mandatory end-of-deliverable `fable-advisor` review. If you still want the Grok lane, grab [`grok-implementer.md` from the v3.1 tree](https://github.com/DannyMac180/fable-advisor/blob/b3b50a9/agents/grok-implementer.md).

**Why a GPT lane in a Claude plugin?** Vendor diversity. Models from one family share blind spots; an independent implementation from a different lineage catches what same-family review misses — and with Claude as the architect and reviewer, every routine diff gets cross-vendor review for free. The architect and reviewer stay Claude — the routine lane is a producer, not a judge.
